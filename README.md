# Homely
Home Assistant Homely Alarm System integration

Since Homely API is read-only, system state is implemented as a sensor and not as an Alarm Control Panel.
For the moment it supports temperature and battery level from all connected devices

Files must manually be copied to /config/custom_components/homely
for example by using the Samba share add-on.
